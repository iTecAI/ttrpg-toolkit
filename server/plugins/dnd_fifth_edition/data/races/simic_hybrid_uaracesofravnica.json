They exhibit signs of slightly accelerated aging, so their maximum lifespans are probably reduced somewhat, but the Guardian Project has not been operating long enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon.",

They are more interested in scientific research and the standing of their guild than in moral or ethical questions. However, those who leave the Combine often do so because their philosophical outlook and alignment are more in line with a different guild's.",

Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
