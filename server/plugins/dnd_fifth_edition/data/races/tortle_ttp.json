            "**Age:** Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 15 and live an average of 50 years.",
            "",
            "**Alignment:** Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop customs and routines, becoming more set in their ways as they age. Most are lawful good. A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.",

            "**Claws:** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to **1d4** + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.",

Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.",

While in your shell, you are *prone*, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.",
